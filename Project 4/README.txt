I currently run an Acer with Windows 7 on it. I wrote all my code in Dr. Java with the JDK 6 compiler. 

SortTest1 is the class that tests the behavior of all three sorting algorithms:
	To Run the Program Type: Run SortTest1
	The program should run just fine. 

SortTest2 is the class that takes a file and and runs the three sorting algorithms on them
and returns the time.
	To Run the Program Type: Run SortTest2 <Enter File Name Here>
	The program should run just fine.

Sort is a class that holds the three sorting algorithms.
